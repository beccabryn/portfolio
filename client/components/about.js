          Allow me to introduce myself... My name is Becca, and I'm a Software
          Engineer. I just graduated from the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack
          Academy. Through that program, I explored my love for solving complex
          technical problems.

          Before my time at the Grace Hopper Program, I studied Business
          Marketing in college and practiced that in the publishing industry for
          a couple of years. After graduating college, I felt a lot of pressure
          to find the path that would make me ‘successful’. However, I quickly
          realized that success came from finding joy and passion in my work.
          That wasn’t the case for me in marketing. If there is one thing I
          learned from the Grace Hopper program, it is that there are not only
          so many problems in this world, but so many solutions as well. And I
          would love to be a part of that solution.
